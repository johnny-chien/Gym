"""Verifier fixture for NeMo Gym's manifest onboarding checks.

``gym env test <environment>`` imports the resources server's ``app.py``, takes its
``VERIFIER_FIXTURE`` and exercises the scorer in-process against ``tests/verifier_cases.jsonl``:
a full-reward case that must pin the top of the declared reward range, a zero-reward case that
must pin the bottom, a malformed case that must raise, and, for seeded environments, a
determinism case that must reproduce on a fresh server. The cases script episodes on the
self-contained fixture suite in ``tests/fixtures/mini_suite``, so the check needs no download,
and they are scored through the same code as ``/verify``.
