"""Turn a loaded suite into NeMo Gym JSONL rows.

Each row follows the NeMo Gym data contract: ``responses_create_params`` in OpenAI Responses
API shape (system + user messages, function tools; ``system`` rather than ``developer`` because DeepSeek, Gemini and other OpenAI-compatible providers reject the ``developer`` role), plus top-level fields the resources
server reads back at ``/seed_session`` and ``/verify`` (``task_id`` above all). Rows carry no
answers, verifiers, or seed data; those stay inside the task package on the server side.
