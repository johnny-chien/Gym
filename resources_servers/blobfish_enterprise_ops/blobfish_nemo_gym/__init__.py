"""Blobfish suites as NeMo Gym environments.

The stdlib core (``suite``, ``dataset``, ``emit``) has no third-party dependencies and works
without NeMo Gym installed. ``server`` layers the NeMo Gym resources server on top and imports
``nemo_gym`` lazily, so ``import blobfish_nemo_gym`` never fails on a machine without it.
